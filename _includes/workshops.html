    <h3 class="center">Data visualisation in R, from ggplot2 to gganimate</h3>
<!--     <h5 class="center">Sub-title</h5> -->
    <h4>Danielle Navarro</h4>

    <p>This hands on workshop will provide an introduction to data visualisation in R. The core of the workshop will focus on creating clean data visualisations with ggplot2, and turning them into animations with gganimate. The workshop is aimed at a beginner to intermediate level. Some prior familiarity with tidyverse (dplyr, ggplot2) would be helpful but not assumed, as the workshop will include a refresher / quick tutorial for beginners.
</p>
    <p>Topics covered will include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Building and customising plots with ggplot2</li>
      <li>Understanding how ggplots are structured</li>
      <li>Building animated plots with gganimate</li>
      <li>Links between human vision and data visualisation </li>
      <li>Interactive plots with ggplotly</li>
      <li>Under the hood: graphics devices, grid graphics, etc</li>
    </ul>
