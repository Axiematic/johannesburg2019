  								<div class="session-abstract abstract">
  								<p>R provides several packages to help wrangle geometries. Many of these geometry packages precede the tidyverse  - meaning they are almost impossible to use correctly with the tidyverse. This talk will walk you through the principles of using `sf` - a spatial package that is tidy compliant.</p>

  								<div class="session-abstract abstract">
  								<p> FlowCAr is a R package which allows the user to understand the 'ins and outs' of any flow network. With limited data, a complex flow network can be accurately modeled, visualized and analysed. Using various sources of a data, the unknown information in a system can be solved and the system analysed.</p>

  								<p> rOpenSci is a community of researchers and software developpers working together to provide better R tooling, mostly packages, for reproducible and open science. Some of these packages are contributed by staff, others by community members. In order to ensure quality of packages in the suite, rOpenSci _onboards_ packages from the community by having them undergo an open review process on GitHub. In this talk, you'll get introduced to this onboarding system. You'll hear about brand-new analyses of the system in R thanks to my [rectangling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GapSskrtUzU) onboarding. You'll also get to learn about our continuous efforts at improving our system even more, in particular via automation. Come hear this talk if you want to know more about software review and about Git(Hub) data analysis! </p>
