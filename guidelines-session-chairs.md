## Session Chair Guidelines

Your responsibilities as a session chair are to:

### Before the Session

- ensure that all speakers for your session are present,
- confirm that each speaker's slides have been loaded & tested and
- confirm with speaker that version of slides is correct.

A technical support person will be on hand to facilitate this with each of the speakers, but it's up to you to ensure that it has been done.

### During the Session

- briefly introduce each speaker and highlight the title/subject of their talk;
- keep track of time and notify the speaker; and
- help facilitate questions at the end of the talk.

There will only be question time for standard and keynote talks. Try to formulate your own question for each of these talks in case there are no questions from the floor. It's best for each speaker to field at least one question.

### Timekeeping

To help give timing feedback to the speakers you'll be provided with flashcards. For keynote and standard talks you should notify the speaker when they have 10, 5, 2 and 1 minutes remaining. For lightning talks you should notify the speaker when they have 2 and 1 minutes to go.

When a speaker is out of time, stand up and make it clear to the speaker that they need to bring things to a close rapidly.

### Time Allocation

- 1 minute transition time between all talks
- keynote talk: 45 minutes (ideally 5 minutes for questions, but can probably be left to the speakers discretion)
- standard talk: 20 minutes (15 minutes talk time, 5 minutes for questions)
- lightning talk: 5 minutes
